# Youtube Dog Video Search

Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to search the Dogs category of Youtube via the YouTube Data API v3. This web application was built using React.

[ ] Create a home component that lists videos.

[ ] Allow search within the Dog category on both the home component and video component (example: q = dog + query).

[ ] Show description/title/thumbnail for every video listed on the home page after a search is entered.

[ ] Allow videos to be opened in a new page. This would require the creation of a second component.

[ ] The video component must display the video itself, the title, and the name of the channel that posted it.

[ ] Implement pagination or infinity scrolling for said list of videos.

[ ] Create a README that outlines your application and how to run it.
